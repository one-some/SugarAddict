# SugarAddict
Userscript tool for editing the state of SugarCube games.

## Features
- Variable editing (including complicated-ish things like nested objects and arrays and such)
- Passage jump
- Passage code viewer

## Maybe future features (maybe)
- "Capture variable changes" (think Cheat Engine) -- for now changes are outputted in the console.
- Syntax highlighting in code viewer
- Passage editing in code viewer
- Check patching in code viewer
- Click variable in code viewer to jump to it in variable editor
- Passage content search
- Open specific passage in code viewer
- Resizable window
- Better support for different versions and configurations, currently game compatibility isn't the best

I'm pretty bored with this so I frankly doubt any of this stuff will be implemented
