# SugarAddict

Extension for editing the state of story-oriented web games.

### Notes

- The extension is Firefox only for now due to me using Firefox. If you want a Chrome version make an issue and it might happen in a few years

## Features

### SugarCube Games

- Variable editing (including complicated-ish things like nested objects and arrays and such)
- Passage jump
- Passage code viewer

### RPG Maker Games

- Walkspeed manipulation
- Forcemove (Walk through walls, during cutscenes, whatever you want)
- Edit money
- Recover player/party (all stats to full in battle)
- Give/remove items

### Ren'PyWeb Games

- Variable editor
- Python interpreter (game state shell)
- Enable things like superskip
- Manually manage memory (6 GB of ram is a little excessive for a visual novel)

## Maybe future features (maybe)

### SugarCube

- Syntax highlighting in code viewer
- Passage editing in code viewer
- Check patching in code viewer
- Click variable in code viewer to jump to it in variable editor
- Passage content search
- Open specific passage in code viewer
- Better support for different versions and configurations, currently game compatibility isn't the best

### RPG Maker

- Lock stats (ie dont take damage in battle)
- Item icon previews
- Interpeter manipulation (teleport to scene?)
- Actor/party editor
- Item stat editor

### Ren'Py

- Force save/skip
- Passage decompiler(?)

### General

- Resizable window

I'm pretty bored with this so I frankly doubt any of this stuff will be implemented
